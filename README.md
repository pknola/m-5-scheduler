## Installation
{{To install and use this application you can open the URL in your browser where it should be set up to work with any of the regular browsers.  It will open with a Title of the "Word Day Scheduler" and show the current date with various time slots available to enter. To begin, I will need to create my repository and use the starter code provided.  I then needed to make adjustments to the code so that my scheduler would do the following:
1. It will open showing the current day at the top
2. When I scroll down, it will show me time slots, it will be color coded to show the past, present and future.
3. When I click on a time slot, it will allow me to enter data and save it to my scheduler on my local storage }}

## Usage
{{To use the scheduler, click in any of the available time slots shown and begin typing in your data.  Please note that the past time slots will be gray, the current time will be purple and the future will show......  Once you enter your schedule data in the time slot, then click the save button a the right of the time slot to save it.}}

## License
{{No license is necessary for the use of the scheduler at this time.  Possibly at a later time!}}

## Contributing
{{The training of UCI Bootcamp, the use of W3 Schools, MDN Web Docs, and Coding for Dummies all contributed to the creation.  The use of the API Workday Scheduler was also preloaded.}}

## Tests
{{Several tests were ran to ensure that all aspects of the app were working.  Opening the index.html in the live server and then using the developers inspect to see the elements were coded in the proper placement or if testing to be done to see where something would show up (or not) and then console.log ran which will keep showing a timed out listener that corrects itself upon refresh.  Never could figure this out to go away.  The application local storage was verified to show the local storage memory.  Finally, the page was tested for flexing.}}
