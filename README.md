Work Day Scheduler

##Because I have a busy lifestyle, I found that it would be best to schedule my time efficiently.  Therefore, following the Day.js scheduler format I began to create a scheduler
##To begin, I will need to create my repository and use the starter code provided.  I then needed to make adjustments to the code so that my scheduler would do the following:
1. It will open showing the current day at the top
2. When I scroll down, it will show me time slots, it will be color coded to show the past, present and future.
3. When I click on a time slot, it will allow me to enter data and save it to my scheduler on my local storage

##Creation - researching the past examples, using W3, Chatgpt.
